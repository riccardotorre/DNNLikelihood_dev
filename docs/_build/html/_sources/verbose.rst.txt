Notes on verbose implementation
-------------------------------

The verbose mode for several classes, methods, and functions in this package are implemented through a modification
of the built-in ``print`` function, corresponding to the following piece of code:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import builtins

    ShowPrints = True
    def print(*args, **kwargs):
        global ShowPrints
        if type(ShowPrints) is bool:
            if ShowPrints:
                return builtins.print(*args, **kwargs)
        if type(ShowPrints) is int:
            if ShowPrints != 0:
            return builtins.print(*args, **kwargs)
