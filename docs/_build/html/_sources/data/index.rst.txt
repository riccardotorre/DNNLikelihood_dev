The Data object
----------------------

The :class:`Data <DNNLikelihood.Data>` class acts as a data container. It is used by :ref:`the DNNLikelihood object <DnnLik_object>` 
and :ref:`the DNNLikelihood Ensemble object <DnnLikEnsemble_object>` to manage training/validation/test data
through the :class:`Data.data_dictionary <DNNLikelihood.Data.data_dictionary>` dictionary.
See the documentation of :ref:`the DNNLikelihood object <DnnLik_object>` and 
:ref:`the DnnLikEnsemble object <DnnLikEnsemble_object>` for more details on how the
:class:`Data <DNNLikelihood.Data>` object is used when building the DNNLikelihood.
